THE XVA DEBATES ARE OFFICIALLY OVER, AND THE "PRAGMATISTS" WON. 🏛️📉

For years, academics like John Hull and Alan White argued that FUNDING VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS (FVA) were theoretically incorrect. But the market disagreed. Today, banks charge for everything: CREDIT, FUNDING, CAPITAL, and MARGIN.

But the victory of "Market Practice" created a new monster: COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY. 💻🔥😱

Calculating CAPITAL VALUATION ADJUSTMENT (KVA) under Basel III rules requires "NESTED MONTE CARLO" simulations — essentially RUNNING A SIMULATION INSIDE A SIMULATION. We are talking about 10 million+ calculations per trade. It is prohibitively slow.

That is why even the critics have pivoted to DEEP LEARNING.

Try *deep-xva*, a repository exploring this shift. It compares two approaches:
1. 🐢 The "CLASSIC" Approach: QuantLib + Hull-White models (demonstrating the nested simulation bottleneck).
2. 🚀 The "MODERN" Approach: A PyTorch Neural SDE solver (Deep BSDE) that learns the hedging and capital profile in a single pass.

The cool kids are using "DEEP XVA SOLVERS" to replace traditional numerical methods to handle the massive capital requirements of the Basel III Endgame.
